	abstract = {"Introducing Data Science explains vital data science concepts and teaches you how to accomplish the fundamental tasks that occupy data scientists. You'll explore data visualization, graph databases, the use of NoSQL, and the data science process. You'll use the Python language and common Python libraries as you experience firsthand the challenges of dealing with data at scale. Discover how Python allows you to gain insights from data sets so big that they need to be stored on multiple machines, or from data moving so quickly that no single machine can handle it. This book gives you hands-on experience with the most popular Python data science libraries, Scikit-learn and StatsModels"--Back cover},
